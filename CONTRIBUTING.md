## Adding a project

**Important notes**:

- In order to avoid duplicates, please search [existing pull requests](https://github.com/florimondmanca/awesome-asgi/pulls) before submitting a new one.
- Make sure the project you'd like to add is clearly related to ASGI. General-purpose async projects can be submitted to [awesome-asyncio](https://github.com/timofurrer/awesome-asyncio) instead.

Edit `README.md`:

- Choose one of the sections available. If no section fits your project, feel free to [add a section](#adding-a-section).
- Add your project to the section (**keep alphabetical order**): `- [Project name](https://example.com) - A short description which ends with a period.`
- Check your spelling and grammar. âœ…
- Remove any trailing white space, and separate all headers, paragraphs, lists and code snippets with an empty line.

Once that's done, you can [submit a PR](https://github.com/florimondmanca/awesome-asgi/compare). :-)

## Adding a section

- Add the section to the table of contents (**keep alphabetical order**):

```markdown
## Contents

- ...
- [My Section Header](#my-section-header)
```

- Add the section header and description in the `README` (**keep alphabetical order**);

```markdown
## My section header

_My section description._
```
